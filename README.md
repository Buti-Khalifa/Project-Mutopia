# Project Mutopia

**Project Mutopia** is a 2D RPG game made in Unity in just one day. It is unfinished, but it features:

- **Movement**: You can move your character with the arrow keys or WASD.
- **Shooting**: You can shoot bullets with the spacebar or left mouse button. You have limited ammo, so use it wisely.
- **Dashing**: You can dash with the shift key. Dashing makes you invincible and faster for a short time, but it has a cooldown.
- **Enemies**: You will encounter enemies that will try to kill you. Where they will chase you.
- **Loot drops**: When you kill an enemy, it may drop some loot for you. Loot can be ammo, health, or coins.
- **Power-ups**: You can find power-ups in the map that will give you temporary boosts. Power-ups can be speed, damage, fire rate, or infinite dashes.
- **Dash cooldown UI**: You can see how much time is left before you can dash again on the bottom left corner of the screen.
- **Bullet/ammo UI**: You can see how many bullets you have left on the bottom right corner of the screen.
